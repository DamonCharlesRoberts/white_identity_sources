    RQ: Does feelings of racial alienation or opression make members of a racial group perceive members of other racial groups as larger threats?

    Argues:
    - Blumer's theory argues that there can be collective perceptions of a racial hierarchy where some are dominant groups and others are oppressed and alienated.
    - They argue that perceptions of those in other racial groups are driven by this hierarchy and an evaluation of changes to this social order.
      - That is, we may see changes to the social order as generating threat and therefore we will see the individuals in those racial groups as threatening.
    
    Methods:
    - Use data from the 1992 LA County Social survey
    
    Findings:
    - Whites' perceptions of Blacks as zero-sum competitors increase with increasing racial alienation, with negative stereotyping, social distance, and increasing income.

    - Provides an excellent literature review and historical account of social identity theory, how it compares and contrasts to other major theories about identity and how it operates.
    - Social identity theory is primarily a theory about how us versus them can happen. It is a theory of delineation and the varied social contexts in which identities can form, be salient, and shape attitudes and behaviors.
    - SIT sees social context as the key determinant.
    - It first came about from now famous experiments called the mere categorization effect.
      - the theory is not this idea alone. The results from these studies demonstrated that social identities can appear with categorization regardless of competition.
    - The findings here were at odds with RCT which suggests that conflicts between members of groups happen because of competition over resources which would expect that mere categorization cannot happen since it doesn't have pre-established groups that are competing for resources.
    - There are three key principles to SIT:
      - there are psychological processes that explain how social identities are differnt than personal identities
        - because the self is implicated in the group, people are motivated to emphsize and secure the ways in which their group is distinct from others and homogenous within the group.
      - distinguishes between different strategies people use to derive a positive social identity.
      - specifies the key characteristics of the social structurethat dtermine which strategy is most likely to be used.
    - Key predictions of the theory
      - individuals internalize group membership as a meaningful aspect of their self-concept. They will try to make favorable comparisions between this group and relevant outgroups.
      - Social categorization is sufficient to engender intergroup discrimination and inter-group conflict
      - when searching for positive social identity, it can take different forms depending on the beliefs of social reality that are used to justify the group
    - Self-categorization theory (SCT) built upon SIT.
      - the theory argues that self-categorization can happen at different levels of inclusiveness and abstractions (Londoner, UK citizen, European, Human, etc.)

    RQ: What conditions effect the degree to which one reports an identity as central to their self-conception?

    Argues:
    - Uses SIT to argue that group commitment and features of the social context guide the centrality of identity.
    - 1. No threat, low group commitment: leads to noninvolvement
    - 2. No threat, high commitment: leads to identity expression
    - 3. self-directed threat, low commitment: leads to self-affirmation and less expressed desire to be percieved as a group.
    - 4. self-directed threat, high commitment: leads to negative affect and a strong desire to be accepted by the group rather than a desire to find group heterogeneity.
    - 5. group-directed threat, low commitment: leads to negative affective reactions like guilt and to look for ways to distance themselves from the group and to recognize the group’s harm.
    - 6. group-directed threat, high commitment: leads to a desire to protect the group and encourages behavioral responses like group differentiation from other groups and for group affirmation

    - Provides an extremely good literature review of the history of self-categorization theory, how it compares to social identity theory, how it came to be, and what its place is in relation to the other major theories of identity.
    - SCT is an extension upon SIT. In many ways it has similar predictions.
    - It outlines how people can be both individuals and a group member with a number of different identities that can be had. It predicts how and when people define themselves as an individual and as a bgroup. 
    - A key implication of SCT is that a self-category is not just some fixed, cognitive structure in a mental system waiting to be activated. Rather it is a categorization that responds to a dynamic and variable world. 
    - SCT lets us know that identities are not just activated when salient but that there are different features to them that can be salient when activated.
    - Fundamentally, SCT is:
      - a person brings ednuring knowledge about the self to a context. The information is a psychological resource in a given situation and can interact with contextual information to produce a self-categorization with associated attitudes and behaviors.
    - Predictions from SCT:
      - People have both a personal and a social identity.
      - People can define and categorize themselves at different levels of abstraction. You can define yourself as an individual, a memberof a particular group in contrast to others, and a member of a higher-order and more inclusive goroup.
      - Salience explains the way a particular situation is categorized and given meaning. The way this self-categorization happens can explain self-perception and behavior.

  title = {Group-based Hierarchies of Power and Status},
  booktitle = {The Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology},

  annotation = {
    - Provides an excellent literature review of how identity operates and how major theories provides useful predictions about what conditions that attitudes and behavior changes.
    - Major point:
      - merely existing within social hierarchies affects people's psychology and their propensity to engage in political action.
    - Status vs power as concepts:
      - they are theoretically separable. Power indicates control over valued resources and the ability to influence others. Status indicates perceived respect and esteem which can lead to greater influence over others.
    - Realistic conflict theory: suggests that prejudice and conflict stem from competition over scarce resources and group interests.
      - The instrumental model of group conflict: argues that perceptions of resource scarcity and salience of a competitive outgroup guide intergroup competition. Also argues that hierarchy itself facilitiates the perception of limited or scarce resources wheich perpetuates group conflict and hierarchy.
    - Social Dominance Theory:
      - The result of identities
      - suggests that hierarchies emerge due to evolutionary pressures.
      - suggests that individuals interact with hierarchy in one of two ways: hierarchy-enhancing versus hierarchy-attenuating.
      - A central trait predicting social dominance theory is social dominance orientation:
        - it is a fundamental motive underlying hierarchy-enhancing or hierarchy-attenuating behavior.
        - It indicates an orientation towars or preference for group-based dominance and inequality.
        - hierarchy-maintenance outcomes
      - emphasizes hierarchy-enhancing motivations
    - System justification theory:
      - explains why and how hierarchies are preserved once established.
      - Three ways justification occurs:
        - ego justification: want to view oneself positively
        - group-justification: driven by a motive to view one's group positively
        - system-justification: driven by people's desire to view the system or status quo in a favorable light
    - Status characteristics theory
      - sociological perspective on this that compliments the psychological perspectives from SJT and SDT.
      - expectations through group memberships guide status and hierarchies while providing justifications for why they exist.
    - recent work like Kachanoff et al. 2020 demonstrates that white Americans' perceive that other groups are trying to control white Americans. These perceptions predict white Americans' support for working together with others of their racial group.
    - reporting a dominant group identity is central or important to one's sense of self tends to predict support for maintaining or accentuating one's high-statuse place in the hierarchy.
    - work on White racial identity suggests that dominant group members that seek to mitigate the hierarchy may identify with their socially-dominant ingorup but identify in a way that criticizes the existing power structure and perceive their group to possess unearned societal privileges and power.

  annotation = {
    RQ: Why do some Whites percieve whites to be just as discriminated against as Blacks while others don’t?

    Argues:
    - SDO can predict this. Those high in SDO may be extra sensitive to potential threats to the power of Whites in society and they report that Whites are discriminated against more than they are as a way to ensure squash any challenges to the existing racial hierarchy.

    Methods:
    - Study 1a: examines  whether those with higher SDO are more likely to point out instances where Whites are discriminated against as racist and attend less to those that say that an instance discrimination against Blacks was racist.
    - Study 1b: similar to study 1. They assign an example of institutional racism and individual racism per participant to look at within-individual differences on this.
    - Study 2: tries to use less ambiguous individual and more plausible institutional discrimination items.
    
    Findings:
    - Study 1a: those with high levels of SDO are lower on reporting something as institutionally racist when the victim is Black. However, when the victim is white, those high in SDO report higher perceptions in institutional racism than those low on SDO. They find that those low on SDO see the victimizing of subordinate groups as evidence of racism while subordinate groups victimizing dominant groups as not racist. Those with high levels of SDO are opposite of that.
    - Study 1b: those with higher SDO reported that racism was lower for Black victims experiencing institutional and individual discrimination. Whites with higher SDO are resistant to acknowledging racia ldisparities between Blacks and Whites, particularly for institutional forms of discrimination.
    - Study 2: find that those with higher levels of SDO see that Black and White victims report similar levels of institutionalized racism.

    RQ of the book: Why have African Americans remained politically homogenous even though they've become economically polarized? Will this economic polarization lead to greater political diversity in the future?

    Arguement of the book: There has been concurrent political homogenization and a economic heterogenization among Black Americans. This can happen because racial identity consistently is a link for Black Americans and this linked fate with other Black Americans supersedes economic identities; regardless of economics, Black Americans are still Black Americans -- they have similar experiences due to the salience of race in the country.

    RQ: How can we measure white identity?

    Argues:
    - White identity is conceptualized as an automatic association between the self and the white ingroup.
    - Empirical psychology is guilty of the sociological view of whiteness by considering it to be inherently invisible, transparent, or unmarked despite its power to shape lives.
    - Develop a measure of white identity that captures the self-categorization of the not intert and psychologically salient category. Call it the White Identity Centrality Implicit Association test. This measure uses the conceptualization of white identity as the degree to which an individual has incorporated white ingroup membership into their self-concept.
      - It is a measure of the individuals’ hronic self-focus as a white. The higher level their white identity centrality and the more likely they are to shift attention to the self when considering the actions of the ingroup.
      - The individuals that score higher on WICIAT are more likely to experience guilt and negative self-evaluative emotions when made aware of ingroup’s historical transcgressions.

    Methods:
    - studies.

    Findings:
    - Study 1: finds that WICIAT scores were significantly correlated with white ingroup preference IAT scores but not with explicit measures of racial attitudes or white identity centrality. There is also a significnat positive association between home county diversity and WICIAT scores. Compared to those with largely white populations, those in counties with a substantial non-white population show high levels of implicit white identity centraility.
    - Study 2: overall participants divided the black-white continuum near the 50/50 pont. The effect of white ingroup preference IAT score was not significant. However the effect of WICIAT score ws significant such that those with higher WICIAT scores had higher categorization thresholds and excluded more faces from the white ingroup than did low scorers on the WICIAT.
    - Study 3: participants reaction speeds were lower in the middle of the morphing contniuum than at the end points.

    RQ: What are the ways in which Whites tend to interact with their white identity?

    Argues:
    - Historically, the social sciences have often thought that whites are blind to their identity. This is not correct.
    - Whites actively engage with their racial identity and use it to evaluate their world around them.
    - Whites engage with their racial identity in three ways: 
      - deny the existence of privilege
      - distance their own self-concepts from the White category
      - dismantle ystems of privilege
    - Whites tend to default to go with the first two as the third one requires an acknowledge ment of unearned privilege (meritocratic threat) and that they associate with a group that benefits from unfair social advantages (group-image threat). Both of these threats are difficult for whites to accept as it challenges their conception of who they are and the people that are like them.
    - Deny and distancing, the two most common, strategies promote insensitivity and inaction in respect to racial inequality. However, the strategy least common, dismantling, reduces threat by relinquishing privileges.

    RQ: Does a frame of unearned white advantage or non-white disadvantage motivate a desire toreduce inequality work better?

    Argues:
    - Social Dominance Theory would suggest that we aren’t likely to see that a frame telling white people that there is a undeserved disadvantage for non-white groups will move them much on a desire to fix that gap. Instead, a frame telling white people that they have unearned privilege will motivate a guilt response for the self and a desire to distance oneself from the group and to respond with support for the idea to make it harder for whites to continue to benefit from this advantage (not support to give non-whites more advantages, just to harm the group that did something bad; it is still entirely about whites and the dominant group).
    
    Methods:
    - 4 studies
    
    Finds:
    - when faced with racial inequality framed as unearned white advantage,  frames of unearned white advantage increases whites’ support for policies perceived to reduce their group’s economic opportunities but not to increase support for policies perceived to increase minority opportunities. These effects do not happen for frames about minority disadvantage. Additionally find that the effect of unearned white advantage frames on whites’ esteem for their ingroup is what drives the effect for the inequality frame on support for policies perceived to reduce whites’ opportunities.

            Support for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 election was widely attributed to citizens who were “left behind” economically. These claims were based on the strong cross-sectional relationship between Trump support and lacking a college education. Using a representative panel from 2012 to 2016, I find that change in financial wellbeing had little impact on candidate preference. Instead, changing preferences were related to changes in the party’s positions on issues related to American global dominance and the rise of a majority–minority America: issues that threaten white Americans’ sense of dominant group status. Results highlight the importance of looking beyond theories emphasizing changes in issue salience to better understand the meaning of election outcomes when public preferences and candidates’ positions are changing.
          , 
            This study evaluates evidence pertaining to popular narratives explaining the American public’s support for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential election. First, using unique representative probability samples of the American public, tracking the same individuals from 2012 to 2016, I examine the “left behind” thesis (that is, the theory that those who lost jobs or experienced stagnant wages due to the loss of manufacturing jobs punished the incumbent party for their economic misfortunes). Second, I consider the possibility that status threat felt by the dwindling proportion of traditionally high-status Americans (i.e., whites, Christians, and men) as well as by those who perceive America’s global dominance as threatened combined to increase support for the candidate who emphasized reestablishing status hierarchies of the past. Results do not support an interpretation of the election based on pocketbook economic concerns. Instead, the shorter relative distance of people’s own views from the Republican candidate on trade and China corresponded to greater mass support for Trump in 2016 relative to Mitt Romney in 2012. Candidate preferences in 2016 reflected increasing anxiety among high-status groups rather than complaints about past treatment among low-status groups. Both growing domestic racial diversity and globalization contributed to a sense that white Americans are under siege by these engines of change.},

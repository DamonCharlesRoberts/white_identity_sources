In post-mortem analyses of the 2016 Presidential election of Donald J. Trump, a presidential candidate thought to personify white grievance, the stronger than expected presence of non-college educated Whites explains his electoral success \citep{griffin_et-al_2017}. Analyses by political scientists largely contribute Trump's success to his ability to those who see their whiteness as a politically relevant identity \citep{Jardina2020b}. For a long time, political scientists saw white political behavior and attitudes through the lens of prejudice. These analyses exclude whites who exhibit less than explicitly racist views from consideration. More recently, scholars using the Tajfel and Turner \citeyearpar{Tajfel1986} social psychological framework of identity, have challenged this by arguing that some whites may see their whiteness as an identity important and relevant to politics. As a result, while some may express out-group attitudes, others may simply show preference for their in-group \citep{jardina2019} In these electoral post-mortums and in the scholarly debate of who these whites are, some have hinted at theories akin to that of relative depravation \citep[See][]{Huddy2012}. Others, however, argue that white preference for the racial in-group (heretofore referred to as White Identity), follows a more fundamental psychological basis. This paper seeks to examine whether those exhibiting white identity feel a sense of relative material deprivation. 

I argue that white identifiers are not necessarily feeling material status loss. While this may explain why some individuals take on a white identity, it is not the primary reason for this. As work by scholars like Jardina \citep{Jardina2019, Jardina2020} and Schildkraut \citep{Schildkraut2019} suggest, white identity is primarily rooted in the social psychology of identity. Throughout American history, those with the label ``white" \footnote{Though who Americans consider to be white has changed over time. \citep{RileHayward2013}.} enjoy social, economic, and legal privaleges \citep{Wetts2018,Lopez2006}. Speaking to the larger debate of whether economic factors shape one's political views, I argue that white identity does not come from concern about threat to one's and to other white's economic standing. This compliments those arguments of white identity being a process of social identity and not of relative depravation or group competition. 

Using common measures of egotropic and sociotropic economic attitudes, I directly test this argument using survey data from the 2012, 2016, and 2020 American National Election Studies. A discussion of the literature on economic voting suggests that sociotropic evaluations of the economy are the strongest and more consistent predictors of one's political attitudes. If white identity is shaped by motivations relative deprevation, I hypothesize that these factors should predict whether an individual reports a white political identity. The results of these analyses suggest mixed evidence of this hypothesis. I conclude by arguing the presence of this mixed evidence places doubt on claims that white identity comes from whites concerned about a increasingly equal economy. 

\section{Conceptualizing white identity}

The history of what defines one as white in the United States has a long and complicated history. In short, whiteness has been meant to encapsulate those from ethnic and religious groups deemed to be desirable. Further, legalistic definitions in the $19^{th}$ century were used to persecute those deemed to not be saxton to keep them from gaining meaningful employment, and experienced physical violence. While definitions at this time often depended on what academic circles you were most exposed to, at the time, the Irish, Italians, those from countries in the Mediterranean, Jews, and Eastern Europeans were all considered non-staxton and therefore un-American \citep{Painter2010}. While these classifications appear confusing to contemporary Americans, many of these determinants were wrapped up in class \citep{Painter2010}. The ways in which these groups were discriminated against comport with the two common forms of economic ethnic antagonism - efforts to reduce the immigration of these groups and when that fails, to exclude these groups from certain types of work by establishing a form of caste system \citep[see][]{Bonacich1972}. As debates raged through the centuries about who was deemed white both culturally \citep[see][]{Painter2010} and in the legal system \citep[see][]{Lopez2006}, critical race theorists have advocated for people to define their race based on their personal narrative of who they are \citep{RileHayward2013}. 

Those who can and have defined themselves as white have long held more similar racial attitudes than what some political scientists have historically let on. As it turns out, however, whites not only see race, but they tend to rely on racial evaluations for attitude formation \citep{Knowles2014}. One ingredient to theories rooted in social identity theory or social categorization theory is that there has to be a delineation between the groups and members of the in-group have to recognize the delineation \citep{Huddy2001}. It is thought that whites engage in this. Whites have a psychological attachment to other whites \citep{Schildkraut2017} and express a linked fate \citep{Berry2019}.  In doing so, whites evaluate politics both as a prejudice toward non-whites \citep{Kinder1996, Gilens1999, Winter2008, VanDoorn2015, Dovidio2016, Tesler2016, Wetts2018} and as a form of discrimination or group difference\citep{Nelson2016, McDermott2005a, Wong2005, Knowles2014, Schildkraut2017, Jardina2019, Jardina2020}. 

Distinguishing white identity as a political identity from other concepts in political science has been very aptly done by Jardina \citep{Jardina2019}\footnote{See also Wong and Cho \citeyearpar{Wong2005}}. These leading conceptualizations of white identity see it as a source of group difference which is distinct from group competition. Historically, the literature has treated white racial attitudes as the presence of prejudice against an out-group \citep{Tajfel1986, Huddy2001, Huddy2012}. This prejudice has often been measured using a racial resentment scale in political science \citep{Kinder1996, Kinder2010, Tesler2016}. White identity, instead, is measured as an affinity towards other whites \citep{Jardina2019}. This conceptualization comports with common recommendations by social psychologists for establishing the presence of an individual's claiming of a membership with a group and in behaviors and attitudes as motivated by group difference \citep{Leach2008b}. That is, out-group attitudes have been conceptualized as prejudice whereas the popular conceptualization of white identity requires one to express an in-group affinity. 

It is reasonable to expect that racial group affinity can come from a preference for your group as a result of similarity and homogeneity. It may also come from a motivation for security when there is competition. This illustrates that what remains unclear about the current measure of white identity is whether this expression of in-group affinity is really capturing evaluations of group difference or if group competition informs responses to the measure.

abstract = {Here, we integrate prior work to develop and test a theory of how perceived macro-level trends in racial standing shape whites' views of welfare policy. We argue that when whites perceive threats to their relative advantage in the racial status hierarchy, their resentment of minorities increases. This increased resentment in turn leads whites to withdraw support for welfare programs when they perceive these programs to primarily benefit minorities. Analysis of American National Election Studies data and two survey-embedded experiments support this reasoning. In Study 1, we find that whites' racial resentment increased beginning in 2008, the year of Barack Obama's successful presidential candidacy and a major economic downturn, the latter a factor previously shown to amplify racial threat effects. At the same time, whites' opposition to welfare increased relative to minorities'. In Study 2, we sought to better establish the causal effect of racial status threats. We found that experimentally presenting information suggesting that the white majority is rapidly declining increased whites' opposition to welfare, and this effect was mediated by heightened racial resentment. Finally, in Study 3 we found that threatening whites' sense of their economic advantage over minorities led whites to report greater opposition to welfare programs, but only if these programs were portrayed as primarily benefiting minorities, not if they were portrayed as benefiting whites. These findings suggest that whites' perceptions that minorities' standing is rising can produce periods of "welfare backlash" in which adoption of policies restricting or curtailing welfare programs is more likely.},
annote = {QUESTION: What drives white racial resentment towards minorities?

Argues: when whites perceive threats t o their relative advantage in the racial status hierarchy, their resentment of minorities increases. This then drives their withdrawl of support from social welfare programs.

METHODS:
Study 1: 
- Use ANES data to see whether in 2008 there has been an increased opposition to welfare among whites relative to minorities as a result of political and economic events perceived as threats to whites.
- This hypothesis proved true. Beginning in 2008, white attitudes on social welfare diverged quite a bit from URMs.
Study 2: 
- Use an experimental treatment to determine whether being reminded about the declining hierarchical status of whites drive negative views of social welfare programs
- Find support for this hypothesis. Whites who are experimentally treated to think about the increasing diversity of the US and the declining relative status of whites in the US drive those whites to be much less supportive of social welfare programs relative to those not exposed to the treatment.
Study 3:
- Use experimental treatments to determine whether whites who are told that URM's are recieving more entitlement programs decrease support for them or if whites are told that they are recieving more entitlement programs increases white support for the programs.
- Find that whites who are told that whites are benefiting from entitlement programs are more supportive of those programs relative to if they were told that URM's are recieving those same programs.},

- focuses on cooperation to help one another (think of Jardina's finding about white in-groupishness).
- the importance for the group to be cohesive requires that there are norms that foster cooperation and promote punishment of the transgressors.
- The five approaches to group cohesion - cognitive approach predicts cohesion among those in a salient group; realistic interest theory confines cohesion to groups whose members share a common fate, SIT points to heightened unity among those whose status is threatened, social constructivist perspective predicts cohesion among members who share a common understanding of the implications of group membership, an evolutionary approach stresses the importance of identity for development of cooperation and emergence of intergroup conflict under conditions of threat.
- How do we go from social identity to political cohesion?
- subjective identity - like race 
- strong identity
- salience
- convergent identities
- the more our other identities converge on one another, the more we are motivated to protect them.
- group norms are central to political cohesion
- from self-categorization theory, you can look to the protypic group member and evaluate whether you are aligned well with them - especially when identity becomes salient.
- From the realistic theory approach, material interests and relative positioning around material successes or failures in comparison to other groups helps drive political cohesion - this only works among those who are high group identifiers, though...
- social identity theory pushes back against this though by saying it doesn't only need to be materialistic concerns but symbolic threats can do this too.

- high group identifiers react more angrily to group threats
- anger strengthens group identity.

- there is a stronger sense of group commitment when identity is acquired than when ascribed.
- less permeable group boundries and higher incidence of external labeling increase the likelihood that a group member will internalize group identity. Like African Americans having a hard time escaping the label black.
- group size: identification is more pronounced among members of a minority than majority groups. Identitiy develop to the extent that a group satisfies both needs by providing a sense of inclusivenss within the group and distinctiveness between an in-group and out-group

It then uses insights from those responses to develop and test a new measure designed to capture how white identity operates politically. To date, much political science research on white racial identity documents the links between white identity and right-leaning candidate and policy preferences. Much less is known about the role of whiteness on the left. The analysis here shows that even though white liberals talk about anti-racism, privilege, and institutional racism when asked about race and politics and say that they have become more aware of their race in recent years, they generally do not view their own whiteness as a politically salient identity. The results indicate that it is important for scholars to use measures that distinguish between whites who appear "woke" but do not act on their "wokeness" from whites for whom an awareness of privilege motivates them toward an anti-racist agenda.},
annote = {QUESTION: Do left-leaning whites recognize their whiteness in politics and are the less likely than other leftists to act on an anti-racist agenda?

Argues: Though white liberals talk about privilege and institutional racism, they do not see their own whiteness as a politically salient identity. While they claime to be "Woke" they don't work towards promoting an anti-racist agenda.

Methods:
- Collect a series of open-ended and closed-ended survey responses among white liberals and conservatives.
- In the surveys, ask "People belong to many different social and demographic groups. Which group do you belong to that matters most for how you think about politics?" with thre response options randomized by race, gender, region, religion, age, economic, class, or other. Did this to determine what people say affects their views on politics the most. Race was chosen least in the survey. Economic class was the most common response followed by age and religion. 
- It may just be that whiteness is unimportant to them. This is not so. Using a question "Even if being white is not an important part of your identity, would you say that being white is an important factor in your life? (very important to not at all important)". Turns out, that most respondents think that their whiteness is important if not very important to their life. Whites do recognize how important whiteness is to them, even if they don't claim whiteness as their key identity.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, political scientists have demonstrated that racial animus among white Americans is increasingly associated with evaluations of presidential candidates. Like most work on white racial attitudes, these efforts have focused almost exclusively on the out-group attitudes whites possess toward racial and ethnic minorities. Work in social psychology, however, suggests that intergroup attitudes are usually comprised of both an out-group and an in-group component. Nevertheless, political scientists have tended to overlook or dismiss the possibility that whites' in-group attitudes are associated with political evaluations. Changing demographic patterns, immigration, the historic election of Obama, and new candidate efforts to appeal to whites as a collective group suggest a need to reconsider the full nature and consequences of the racial attitudes that may influence whites' electoral preferences. This study, therefore, examines the extent to which both white out-group racial resentment and white in-group racial identity matter in contemporary electoral politics. Comparing the factors associated with vote choice in 2012 and 2016, and candidate evaluations in 2018, this study finds that both attitudes were powerfully associated with candidate evaluations in 2012 and early 2016, although white out-group attitudes overshadowed the electoral impact of in-group racial attitudes by the 2016 general election.

abstract = {Since its rapid rise in early 2009, scholars have advanced a variety of explanations for popular support for the Tea Party movement. Here we argue that various political, economic, and demographic trends and events – e.g., the election of the first nonwhite president, the rising minority population – have been perceived as threatening the relative standing of whites in the U.S., with the resulting racial resentment fueling popular support for the movement. This “decline of whiteness” explanation for white Americans' Tea Party support differs from prior accounts in highlighting the role of symbolic group status rather than personal experience, or economic competition, with minority group members in generating perceptions of threat. We tested this explanation in five survey-based experiments. In Study 1 we sought to make salient the president's African-American heritage by presenting participants with an artificially darkened picture of Barack Obama. White participants shown the darkened photo were more likely to report they supported the Tea Party relative to a control condition. Presenting participants with information that the white population share (Study 2) or income advantage (Study 3) is declining also led whites to report greater Tea Party support, effects that were partly explained by heightened levels of racial resentment. A fourth study replicated the effects of Study 2 in a sample of Tea Party supporters. Finally, Study 5 showed that threatened white respondents reported stronger support for the Tea Party when racialized aspects of its platform (e.g., opposition to immigration) were highlighted, than if libertarian ones (e.g., reduced government spending) were. These findings are consistent with a view of popular support for the Tea Party as resulting, in part, from threats to the status of whites in America. },

- white Americans are more likely to support the tea party iif Obama's AA heritage was made salient to them
- White respondents assigned to the condition where they felt like their majority status was threatened were more likely to support the tea party relative to those in the condition telling them that their status would remain the same.

ARGUE: Through using measures of linked fate, whites have felt increasingly become aware of their whiteness. They feel that their fate is tied to others in their racial groups at comprable levels to minorities. Also find that racial linked fate led to higher rates of participation in mutliple electoral activities. Linked fate did nothing for Democratic turnout in either the 2012 or 2016 Presidential elections.

Measure: Use linked fate - though linked fate is often seen is problmeatic as a measure for whites since there is not a shared history and culture among them, the authors argue that whites do have a linked fate: a history of privilege.},

This article addresses this hole in the literature by examining the extent and effects of White identity. We compare White identification and Black identification using National Election Studies data (1972-2000) and examine the relationships between racial identity and racial and political attitudes.

Use the NES group closeness question to determine who is a white or black identifier and who is a nonidentifier.
- Not the best or most sophisticated but it has a number of advantages: (1) face validity as an indicator of social identity, (2) asked of White and Black respondents about Whites and Blacks as groups
- look at three racial attitudes: affect, sterotypes, and symbolic racism
- in terms of affect, whites and blacks look similar in in-group feelings (whites are 5 points warmer to their own group; whereas blacks are 6 points warmer to their own group)
- whites have more positive sterotypes of whites, they have slightly less positive sterotypes of Blacks, and are more likely to express symbolic racism relative to blacks.},

Prior work has also noted that levels of this identity have been stable across time and data sources. We, however, document a notable decline in levels of white identity in both panel and cross-sectional national survey data immediately after the 2016 presidential election. Using a two-wave panel design, we examine the factors associated with this decline. We examine whether particular emotional reactions, especially disgust toward Donald Trump, pushed some whites away from their racial identity. We also consider the possibility that some whites may have felt that Trump's election reduced perceptions of racial or political threat, therefore lowering levels of white identity. We find the strongest support for the former hypothesis; the decline in white identity was driven mostly by whites expressing disgust toward Trump. Our results highlight the effect that the political environment can have on group identities and point in particular to the significant role that disgust may play in attenuating the strength of group solidarity.},

abstract = {Recent research shows individuals' identification with in-groups to be psychologically important and socially consequential. However, there is little agreement about how identification should be conceptualized or measured. On the basis of previous work, the authors identified 5 specific components of in-group identification and offered a hierarchical 2-dimensional model within which these components are organized. Studies 1 and 2 used confirmatory factor analysis to validate the proposed model of self-definition (individual self-stereotyping, in-group homogeneity) and self-investment (solidarity, satisfaction, and centrality) dimensions, across 3 different group identities. Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated the construct validity of the 5 components by examining their (concurrent) correlations with established measures of in-group identification. Studies 5-7 demonstrated the predictive and discriminant validity of the 5 components by examining their (prospective) prediction of individuals' orientation to, and emotions about, real intergroup relations. Together, these studies illustrate the conceptual and empirical value of a hierarchical multicomponent model of in-group identification. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Psychological Association.},

- In-group homogeneity: The degree to which individuals percieve their entire group as sharing commonalities that make the group relatively homogeneous. It establishes the in-group as a coherent social entity
- Satisfaction: group self-esteem. Focuses on how negative people feel about having a particular group membership. It should really be measured as how well individuals maintain a positive evaluation of the in group.
- Solidarity: should be associated with ones willingness to approach the in-group and group-based activity rater than avoidance of the in-group and its oblegation. 
- Centrality: salience and importance of in-group membership. It should lead individuals to be sensitive to in-group and intergroup events. Members should be sensitive to threats to their in-goup.},

However, membership in a meaningful ‘reference group' typically frames interpersonal comparison, even where individuals do not consciously attend to the group. This makes individuals especially likely to make interpersonal comparisons to other members of their reference group and for these comparisons to be especially affecting psychologically.

Although sociologists have long focused on white ethnic identity, considerations of white racial identity are more recent.

Whiteness has become synonymous with privilege in much scholarly writing, although recent empirical work strives to consider white racial identity as a complex, situated identity rather than a monolithic one. The study of white racial identity can greatly benefit from moving away from simply naming whiteness as an overlooked, privileged identity and by paying closer attention to empirical studies of racial and ethnic identity by those studying social movements, ethnic identity, and social psychology.

abstract = {Scholars find that negative evaluations of Blacks lead Whites to vote against Black political candidates. However, can an in-group psychological process have the same effect? We consider White racial identity to be a strong candidate for such a process. We argue that the mere presence of a Black candidate cues the identity, reducing support for these candidates among Whites. We test this hypothesis on vote choice in seven instances. Five of them involve simple vote choice models: the 2008 and 2012 Presidential elections, and three elections in 2010: The Massachusetts Gubernatorial election, Black candidates for the US House, and Black candidates for the US Senate. The other two are tests of the notion that White racial identity reduced President Obama's approval, thus reducing support for all Democratic Congressional candidates in the 2010 Midterm and 2012 Congressional elections. We find support for these notions in all seven cases, across these seven elections, using four different survey research datasets, and four different measures of White identity. Comparisons with other presidential elections show that White identity did not significantly affect mono-racial elections. Furthermore, we find the White identity and racial resentment results to be very similar in terms of their robustness and apparent effect sizes. This indicates in-group evaluations, and those that focus on out-groups, operate independently of one another.},

ARGUES: As out-group attitudes towards Black candidates decrease white support for them, so too does in-group attitudes decrease white support for Black candidates. The mere presence of a Black candidate cues white racial identity. 

Group identity is dynamic because its salience and meaning vary depending upon people's environments. WHite racial identity may only affect white political behavior in some elections, but not others.

- ARGUES:
- that Linked fate literature fails to explain why people who aren't super group centric still do things to help the group
- Black voters do continuously choose to help the group. 
- They do this because of group pressure. Since it is not just a political identity, but a community, there are a lot of social costs to putting the group's political agenda at risk.

- Experiment 1: had Black students at an HBCU choose whether or not they wanted to donate money to one political candidate or to both Obama and Romney in whatever split they wated.
- They would get a message from the interviewer: one where they wer told that the contribution and name would appear in the newspaper for the school and/or (two different conditions, one where it was the incentive + newspaper condition and one with just the matching, incentive, treatment) that they'd give the participant 1 dollar for every 10 dollars that the participant donated to a randomly assigned candidate. This faces them with self-interest and in the treatment condition with the newspaper it also directly pits social pressure and the threat of being doxxed by their peers against their self-interest. 
- Experiment Results: when only given an incentive, people donated a lot more money to Romney. When assigned to the group where they would have their contributions put in the newspaper, donations increased significantly dor Obama. 
- See that those high on linked fate gave a little bit more than those low on linked fate to Obama. The significance of the linked fate results are not super strong in the face of self-interest.
- Experiment 2: Students from a white university in the Midwest. Students wer given {\$}10 in single dollar bills and were told to enter a classroom with contribution boxes for Obama and Romney. The students were told that for every dollar they put in the box, there would be a matching of every 1 dollar they gave, the candidate would recieve 10. For control condition participants, this was the experience. For those in the treatment conditions they wer told that they would be interviews with another student. This student was a confederate. The black confederate cintition paired the subject with a Black student of the same sex. The white confederate condition paired the subject with a white student of the same sex.They would enter the contribution room together. When entering the contribuiton room alone, they kept most of the money given to them. Subjects in the white confederate condition gave only 4.45 to the Obama campaign. In the presence of black confederates, contributions to Obama were significantly higher with a mean of 6.85.
- Experiment 3: Subjects wer told that for every 10 dollars they allocated to the Romney campaign htey would recieve a 1 dollar payout. They were placed in a context that included the subject and a confederate. The confederate was always black and was asked to make their decision first. Randomly assigned whether the confederate forwent the incentive and gave all the money to the Obama campaign or took the incentive and gave it all to Romney. Subjects in the Obama confederate condition nearly universally allocated all of the possible campaign funds to Obama despite personal incentive to give to romney.},

Also find that macropartisanship clearly incorporates factors that vary and vary irrecularly. gains and losses are "permanent" on a scale of months, not decades. Like economic cyclicality, there is a regular back and fourth dynamic to partisanship.
- these moves correspond with changes in people's economic sentiments.},

abstract = {In ethnic and racial terms, America is growing rapidly more diverse. Yet attempts to extend racial threat hypotheses to today's immigrants have generated inconsistent results. This article develops the politicized places hypothesis, an alternative that focuses on how national and local conditions interact to construe immigrants as threatening. Hostile political reactions to neighboring immigrants are most likely when communities undergo sudden influxes of immigrants and when salient national rhetoric reinforces the threat. Data from several sources, including twelve geocoded surveys from 1992 to 2009, provide consistent support for this approach. Time-series cross-sectional and panel data allow the analysis to exploit exogenous shifts in salient national issues such as the September 11 attacks, reducing the problem of residential self-selection and other threats to validity. The article also tests the hypothesis using new data on local anti-immigrant policies. By highlighting the interaction of local and national conditions, the politicized places hypothesis can explain both individual attitudes and local political outcomes.

abstract = {Objective. Past research has demonstrated that Americans view poverty in racial terms, and that they often blame the poor for their situation. This article's objective is to determine if local contexts can influence these views. Methods. Synthesizing racial and political theories of contextual effects, I use two nationally representative surveys to explore Americans' explanations for poverty. Results. People living in areas where the poor are mostly white are less likely to attribute poverty to the failings of the poor themselves, as theories of racial threat would predict. However, a second finding is stronger: the percentage of the county that voted Republican in the last election consistently predicts less structural and more individualistic explanations of poverty. Conclusions. Local processes of partisan reinforcement play a key role in shaping explanations of poverty. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.},
